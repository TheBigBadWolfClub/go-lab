## Most common type of algorithms

###1. Tree Traversal Algorithms 

These are algorithms that will visit every node in a tree in a structured order. 

They are primarily designed for binary trees, but these concepts can be adapted to visit all the nodes in any tree. 

Learning these algorithms will also help to understand how to recursively traverse through all the nodes in a tree.
The three most common algorithms are:
- Pre-Order 
- In-Order 
- Post-Order traversal

Each of these differs in the order in which they visit the nodes of a tree.

###2. Graph Search Algorithms

These work on trees, graphs with vertices and edges, and any encoding of a graph. 

These algorithms take different approaches to transverse from a starting node to a destination node.

The most common algorithms in this class are :
- Depth First Search (DFS), 
- Breadth First Search (BFS) 
- Dijkstra’s algorithm.

A* algorithm is very usefully to know

###3. Search Algorithms

This is a class of algorithms that really only has one important algorithm: binary search. 

Traditional search is an O(n) algorithm since all nodes are visited one at a time. 

With a sorted input list/tree/array, then it can leverage binary search for an O(log(n)) runtime.

###4. Sorting Algorithms

Bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, etc.

All of these are standard algorithms that should be understood to be able to implement, but these are O(n²) for the average case algorithms. 

Some of those algorithms can sort in O(n*log(n)), two of the most common algorithms in this class are merge sort and quick sort. 

Merge sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n*log(n)) whereas quicksort may drop to a worst-case O(n²).

Heap sort is a sort algorithm that allows easy access to min or max element.
